Rather than building one large program, I‚Äôd like you to code up a few different things with the idea that you‚Äôll learn more by tackling multiple problems and leveraging your understanding of the material in multiple domains. All of these programs should be coded directly within a single repository, which you can get by typing the following:

myth02&gt; hg clone /usr/class/cs110/repos/assign3/$USER assign3

Short Etude (Op. 25, No. 9): Implementing pipeline in C

Your first task is to implement the pipeline function. This pipeline function accepts two argument vectors, and assuming both vectors are legit, spawns off twin daughter processes with the added bonus that the standard output of the first is directed not to the console but rather to the standard input of the second. Here‚Äôs the interface you‚Äôre coding to:

void pipeline(char *argv1[], char *argv2[], pid_t pids[]);

For simplicity, you can assume that all calls to pipeline are well-formed and will work as expected. In other words, argv1 and argv2 are each valid, NULL-terminated argument vectors, and that pids is the base address of an array of length two. Further assume that all calls to pipe, dup2, close, execvp, and so forth succeed so that you needn‚Äôt do any error checking whatsoever. pipeline should return without waiting for either of the child processes to finish (i.e. your pipeline implementation should not call waitpid anywhere), and the ids of the daisy-chained processes are dropped into pids[0] and pids[1]. Also, ensure that the two processes are running in parallel as much as possible, so that pipeline({‚Äúsleep‚Äù, ‚Äú10‚Äù, NULL}, {‚Äúsleep‚Äù, ‚Äú10‚Äù, NULL}, pids) takes about 10 seconds instead of 20.

You should place your implementation of pipeline in pipeline.c, and you can rely on pipeline-test.c and the pipeline-test executable it compiles to exercise your implementation. The pipeline-test.c test harness I start you off with is small, so you should add many more tests of your own to prove that your pipeline is coded to specification.

Note that this first problem is standalone and doesn‚Äôt contribute to anything else that follows (although the concept of a pipeline will come back in Assignment 4).

Short Etude (Op. 25, No. 8): Implementing subprocess in C++

/**

*/

subprocess_t subprocess(char *argv[],

bool supplyChildInput,

bool ingestChildOutput) throw (SubprocessException);static const int kNotInUse = -1; struct subprocess_t {

pid_t pid;

int supplyfd; int ingestfd;

};

/**

* Function: subprocess

* ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äì * Creates a new process running the executable identified via argv[0].

*

* argv: the NULL-terminated argument vector that should be passed to the

* be pushed to the parent, false otheriwse

*/

subprocess_t subprocess(char *argv[],

bool supplyChildInput,

bool ingestChildOutput) throw (SubprocessException);

Read through the subprocess.h documentation to see how this new subprocess should work, and place your implementation in subprocess.cc. Should any of the system calls needed to implement your subprocess routine fail (either in the parent or in the child), you should throw a SubprocessException around an actionable error message. Inspect the subprocess-exceptions.h file for the full, inlined definition.

Use the test harness supplied by subprocess-test.cc (the .cc extension means that that code within it is C++) to exercise your implementation, and by all means add to the subprocess-test.cc file to ensure that your implementation is bulletproof. When looking at subprocess-test.cc, you‚Äôll also get a little bit of a reminder how try/catch blocks work. Be sure to add your own tests to subprocess-test.cc to ensure that all the (true, true), (true, false), (false, true), and (false, false) combinations for (supplyChildInput, ingestChildOutput) all work as expected.

Note that your implementation here is formally C++, since the two larger exercises that follow this one are also to be written in C++, and they each need to link against your subprocess implementation without drama. We‚Äôre switching to C++ pretty much from this problem forward, because C++ provides better support for strings and generics than C does. C++ also provided native support for some threading and concurrency directives we‚Äôll be relying on a few weeks, and I‚Äôd rather ease you into the language now than do so when we branch into the multithreading topic. Truth be told, your C++ implementation of subprocess will look as it would have in pure C, save for the fact that you‚Äôre throwing C++ exceptions to identify errors.

Your fully functional subprocess routine is used by code I wrote for the next exercise (the one requiring you to implement trace) and by the starter code I‚Äôve given you for the final exercise of the entire assignment (the one requiring you implement the prime factorization farm).

Long Etude (Op. 10, No. 4): Implementing trace in C++

trace is a systems programming tool that helps us profile the execution of a secondary process and present information about all of the system calls‚Äîthat is, function calls into the kernel‚Äîthat the secondary executable makes. Specifically, the secondary process makes calls to system calls you certainly know about (e.g. open, stat, read, write, close, sleep) and ones you probably don‚Äôt (mmap, mprotect, ioctl, recv, getdents).

The process running trace is called the tracer, and the process being profiled is called the tracee.

trace can be invoked in two different modes: simple and full (and your implementation needs to support both). When run in simple mode, trace publishes information about all of the tracee‚Äôs system calls via a bare-bones presentation. Only system call codes and raw return values are posted‚Äînothing about arguments, data types, or specific error information. To illustrate, consider the following program (you‚Äôll see it in your repo as simple-test5.cc):

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { write(STDOUT_FILENO, ‚Äú12345 ‚Äú, 6);

int fd = open(__FILE__, O_RDONLY); write(fd, ‚Äú12345 ‚Äú, 5);

close(fd);

read(fd, NULL, 64); close(/* bogusfd = */ 1000);

return 0;

}

Assuming the above has been compiled into an executable called simple-test5, its bare-bones trace might look like this:

myth5&gt; ./trace ‚Äìsimple ./simple-test5 syscall(59) = 0 syscall(12) = 35303424

// many lines omitted for brevity syscall(1) = 12345

6

syscall(1) = 6 syscall(2) = 3 syscall(1) = -9

syscall(3) = 0 syscall(0) = -9 syscall(3) = -9 syscall(231) = &lt;no return&gt;

Program exited normally with status 0 myth5&gt;

There are a lot of magic numbers there, but I promise that the numbers in parentheses are system call numbers (59 is for execve, 0 is for read, 1 is for write, 2 is for open, 3 is for close, 12 is for brk, 231 is for exit_group) and the numbers after the equals signs are return values (that 6 is the number of characters published by write, the -9‚Äôs express write‚Äôs, read‚Äôs, and close‚Äôs inability to function when handed closed, incompatible, or otherwise bogus file descriptors, and exit_group never returns (gulp!)).

When run in full mode (i.e. without the ‚Äìsimple flag), trace pulls out all of the stops and prints oodles of information about each of calls:

myth5&gt; ./trace ./simple-test5

execve(‚Äú./simple-test5‚Äù, 0x7ffeb3d1a460, 0x7ffeb3d1a470) = 0 brk(NULL) = 0xbbcffe04

// many lines omitted for brevity write(1, ‚Äú12345

‚Äú, 6) = 12345

6

open(‚Äúsimple-test5.cc‚Äù, 0, 6) = 3 write(3, ‚Äú12345

‚Äú, 5) = -1 EBADF (Bad file descriptor) close(3) = 0

read(3, NULL, 64) = -1 EBADF (Bad file descriptor) close(1000) = -1 EBADF (Bad file descriptor) exit_group(0) = &lt;no return&gt;

Program exited normally with status 0 myth5&gt;

You can see the return values, if negative, are always -1, but that some errno value is printed after that in #define constant form, followed by a specific error message. It turns out that #define constant is always mapped to the absolute value of the system call‚Äôs return value (so in this case, 2), and you can easily get the more detailed error message by passing the constant (in this case 2) to the strerror function.

Understanding ptrace

A key function needed for this groovy piece of software to work is called ptrace, and you can get an abundance of information about it by typing manptrace at the command line. The ptrace function is itself a system call, and our trace tool relies on it to monitor and even manipulate the execution of the tracee, inspect the contents of the tracee‚Äôs virtual address space, and even inspect the contents of the registers (e.g. %rax, %rsi, %rsp, and so forth).

The full prototype of ptrace looks like this:

long ptrace(enum __ptrace_request request, pid_t pid, void *addr, void *data);

The first argument to ptrace is always some enumerated constant (e.g. PTRACE_SYSCALL, PTRACE_PEEKUSER, PTRACE_TRACEME), and the choice of constant dictates how many additional arguments are needed and what happens as a side effect of calling it. You can read through the man page for a description of all of the different constants, but I summarize below the list of constants you‚Äôll need for a working solution.

‚óè PTRACE_TRACEME: Used by the tracee to state its willingness to be manipulated and inspected by its parent. No additional arguments are required, so a simple call to ptrace(PTRACE_TRACEME) does the trick.

‚óè PTRACE_PEEKUSER: Used by the tracer to inspect and extract the contents of a tracee‚Äôs register at the time of the call. Only the first three arguments are needed, and any value passed through data is ignored. A call to ptrace(PTRACE_PEEKUSER, pid, RSI * sizeof(long)), for instance, returns the contents of the tracee‚Äôs %rsi register at the time of the call (provided the supplied pid is the process id of the tracee, of course). There are constants for all registers (RAX, RSI, RBX, RSP, etc), and the third argument is supposed to be scaled by the size of a word on that processor (which is, by definition, the size of a long). If the tracee temporarily freezes at the time a system call is made, then the registers contain information about what the system call is (because a number representing the system call is passed through via %rax) and what its arguments are (because the integers, strings, and pointers passed through as arguments sit in %rdi, %rsi, %rdx,%r10, %r8, and %r9). Of course, some system calls don‚Äôt take any arguments (e.g. fork), some take just one (e.g. sleep, close), and some require more (dup2 requires 2; read, write; waitpid require three; and a few like pselect require all six). When a system call returns, its return value is either an integer or a pointer, and those contents reside in %rax.

‚óè PTRACE_PEEKDATA: Used by the tracer to inspect and extract the word of data residing at the specified location within the tracee‚Äôs virtual address space. A call to ptrace(PTRACE_PEEKDATA, pid, 0x7fa59a8b0000) would return the eight bytes residing at address 0x7fa59a8b0000 within the tracee‚Äôs virtual address space, and a call to ptrace(PTRACE_PEEKDATA, pid, ptrace(PTRACE_PEEKUSER, pid, RDI * sizeof(long)) would return the eight bytes residing at another address, which itself resides in %rdi). If you know the contents of a register is an address interpretable as the base address of a ‚Äù-terminated C string, you can collect all of the characters of that string by a sequence of PTRACE_PEEKDATA calls.

‚óè ptrace(PTRACE_SYSCALL, pid, 0, 0) instructs the tracee to continue with the understanding that the tracee will halt as it enters a system call (i.e. when the registers have been populated with a system call code and all of its arguments) or returns from one (i.e. when the system call‚Äôs return value has been dropped into %rax. And because the tracee halts, it‚Äôs easy for the tracer to halt via a strategic call to waitpid until it‚Äôs time for the register set to be inspected. From the tracer‚Äôs point of view, the tracee will be stopped by a SIGTRAP, which is the signal used as part of the system function call and return to transition between user mode and kernel mode).

‚óè ptrace(PTRACE_SETOPTIONS, pid, 0, PTRACE_O_TRACESYSGOOD) instructs the kernel to set bit 7 of the wait status to be 1 for all SIGTRAPs sent to the tracer because a system call was made. A SIGTRAP signal can be sent for many reasons (e.g. the tracee calls raise(SIGTRAP) as part of execution, or the tracee might be some gdb-like process that itself uses ptrace and relies on SIGTRAPs to be fired at it because a value being watched hanged, or because execution hit some set breakpoint). Bottom line: PTRACE_SETOPTIONS and PTRACE_O_TRACESYSGOOD help us distinguish SIGTRAPs generated by system calls from other SIGTRAPs.

Here is a key part of the ptrace man page (slightly edited for clarity):

A process can initiate a trace by calling fork and having the resulting child do a PTRACE_TRACEME, followed by a raise(SIGSTOP) (which causes the child process to self-halt until instructed by the tracer to continue), followed by the execvp. While being traced, the tracee will stop each time a signal is delivered, even if the signal is being ignored. The tracer will be notified at its next call to waitpid; that call will return a status value containing information that indicates the cause of the stop in the tracee. While the tracee is stopped, the tracer can use various ptrace requests to inspect the tracee. The tracer then prompts the tracee to continue.

Tips and Tidbits

‚óè When run in full mode, you‚Äôll need access to a collection of maps storing system call function names, system call signatures, and return types. You‚Äôll also need to know what #define constants should be printed (in text form) when system calls fail. I‚Äôm giving you a bunch of libraries that crawl over a subset of the system header files to extract information about system call numbers and errno constants, and over a reasonably large number of source files implementing the Linux kernel. You‚Äôre welcome to peruse the trace-error-constants.cc and trace-system-calls.cc source files, but you really only need to read through the corresponding interface files to understand what they do for you. (The function that crawls over the Linux kernel code base in /usr/src/linux-source-3.13.0/linux-source-3.13.0 assumes a working subprocess implementation, so you‚Äôll need to make sure you get that working before you can expect the support libraries to work).

‚óè The very first time you run trace, you should expect it to take a very long time to read in all of the prototype information for the linux kernel source tree. All of the prototype information is cached in a local file after that (the cache file will sit in your repo with the name .trace_signatures.txt), so trace will fire up much more quickly after that. Should you want to rebuild the prototype cache for any reason, you can invoke trace with the ‚Äìrebuild flag, as with trace ‚Äìrebuild make clean.

‚óè For the purposes of this assignment, you can assume that all return values should be printed as integers, except for brk and mmap, which we‚Äôll assume return void*‚Äôs. This information isn‚Äôt as easily extracted from the headers or kernel source as you might think, so I‚Äôm going with a massive simplification here.

‚óè There are a collection of string utility functions I wrote that reside in /usr/class/cs110/ local/include/string-utils.h, and you can use them by #include‚Äôing string-utils.h.

‚óè The x86_64 architecture requires that system call function codes and return values be placed in %rax. System call arguments are placed in %rdi, %rsi, %rdx, %r10, %r8, and %r9 as needed. To be clear, the first argument if needed is placed in %rdi; the second argument, if needed, is placed in %rsi; and so forth.

‚óè Earlier, I mentioned the system call function code is passed in via %rax and that‚Äôs true. But by the time that necessary PTRACE_PEEKUSER call gets made, the true %rax has been clobbered. Fortunately, the solution is to, for just this one scenario, rely on ORIG_RAX instead, which still houses the system call code at the time you need it.

‚óè One particularly tricky part: printing a system call argument when that argument is a string. The base address of that string‚Äôs leading character will sit in a register, and you‚Äôll need to use a combination of PTRACE_PEEKUSER and PTRACE_PEEKDATA to reconstitute the string so that it can be printed.

‚óè All arguments are either ints, char *s, or general pointers. The long returned by ptrace needs to be truncated to an int, converted to a C++ string, or reinterpreted as a void * before printing it.

‚óè The sys/reg.h header defines a collection of constants used to represent registers, and they are always all-caps versions of the registers they represent: RAX, RSI, RBX, etc.

‚óè The return value of trace is always the return value of the tracee. You needn‚Äôt worry about tracees that exit because of some uncaught signal, as that requires more advanced ptrace work, because tracees don‚Äôt always properly report their own death via WIFEXITED and WIFSIGNALED when terminated by a signal.

‚óè My own solution has been compiled into an executable named trace_soln, and it‚Äôs sitting in /usr/class/cs110/samples/assign3. Feel free to play with it and compare what it generates to what yours does. Your assign3 repo contains a symlink called slink, which is an alias for /usr/class/cs110/samples/assign3.

Scherzo No. 4: Implementing farm in C++

Your final challenge is to harness the power of a computer‚Äôs multiple cores to manage a collection of executables, each running in parallel to contribute its share to a larger result. For the purposes of this problem, we‚Äôre going to contrive a scenario where the computation of interest‚Äîthe prime factorization of arbitrarily large numbers‚Äîis complex enough that some factorizations take multiple seconds or even minutes to compute. The factorization algorithm itself isn‚Äôt the focus here, save for the fact that it‚Äôs potentially time consuming, and that should we need to compute multiple prime factorizations, we should leverage the computing resources of our trusty Unix cluster machines to multiprocess and generate output more quickly.

Consider the following Python program called factor.py:

self_halting = len(sys.argv) &gt; 1 and sys.argv[1] == ‚Äò‚Äìself-halting‚Äô pid = os.getpid() while True:

if self_halting: os.kill(pid, signal.SIGSTOP)

try: num = int(raw_input()) # raw_input blocks, eventually returns a single line from stdin

except EOFError: break; # raw_input throws an EOFError when EOF is detected

start = time.time()

response = factorization(num)

stop = time.time()

print ‚Äò %s [pid: %d, time: %g seconds]‚Äô % (response, pid, stop ‚Äì start)

You really don‚Äôt need to know Python to understand how it works, because every line of this particular program has a clear C or C++ analog. The primary things I‚Äôll point out are:

‚óè Python‚Äôs print operates just like C‚Äôs printf (and it‚Äôs even process-safe)

‚óè raw_input reads and returns a single line of text from standard input, blocking indefinitely until a line is supplied

(chomping the ‚Äò ‚Äò) or until end-of-file is detected

‚óè factorization is something I wrote; it takes an integer (e.g. 12345678) and returns the prime factorization (e.g. 12345678 = 2 * 3 * 3 * 47 * 14593) as a string. You‚Äôll see it when you open up factor.py in your favorite text editor

‚óè The os.kill line prompts the script to stop itself (but only if the script is invoked with the

‚Äò‚Äìself-halting‚Äô flag) and wait for it to be restarted via SIGCONT

The following should convince you our script does what you‚Äôd expect (I‚Äôm using bash here, where the time builtin clocks the entire pipeline):

You‚Äôre going to write a program‚Äîa C++ program called farm‚Äîthat can run on the myths or the ryes. farm will spawn several workers‚Äîone for each core, each running a self-halting instance of factor.py, read an unbounded number of positive integers (one per line, no error checking required of you for this problem either), forward each integer on to an idle worker (blocking until one or more workers is ready to read the number), and allow all of the workers to cooperatively publish all prime factorizations to standard output (without worrying about the order in which they‚Äôre printed). To illustrate how farm should work, check out the following test case:

real 0m10.667s user 0m41.197s

Your farm.cc implementation will make use of the following C++ record, global constants, and global variables:

static const size_t kNumCPUs = sysconf(_SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN);

static vector&lt;worker&gt; workers(kNumCPUs); // space for kNumCPUs, zero-arg constructed workers

static size_t numWorkersAvailable = 0;struct worker {

worker() {}

worker(char *argv[]) : sp(subprocess(argv, true, false)), available(false) {}

subprocess_t sp;

bool available;

};

static const size_t kNumCPUs = sysconf(_SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN); static vector&lt;worker&gt; workers(kNumCPUs); // space for kNumCPUs, zero-arg constructed workers

static size_t numWorkersAvailable = 0;

The main function we give you includes stubs for all of the helper functions that decompose it, and that main function looks like this:

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { signal(SIGCHLD, markWorkersAsAvailable);

spawnAllWorkers();

broadcastNumbersToWorkers();

waitForAllWorkers();

closeAllWorkers();

return 0; }

This final problem can be tricky, but it‚Äôs perfectly manageable provided you follow this road map:

‚óè Advance on to spawnAllWorkers, which spawns a self-halting factor.py process for each core and updates the global workers vector so that each worker contains the relevant subprocess_t allowing farm.cc to monitor it and pipe prime numbers to it. You can assign a process to always execute on a particular core by leveraging functionality outlined in the CPU_SET and sched_setaffinity man pages (i.e. type in manCPU_SET to learn about the cpu_set_t type, the CPU_ZERO and CPU_SET macros, and the sched_setaffinity function).

‚óè Implement the markWorkersAsAvailable handler, which gets invoked whenever one of the child processes self-halts (prompting the kernel to SIGCHLD signal the parent). Call waitpid to surface the pid of the child that recently self-halted, and mark it as available.

‚óè Implement a getAvailableWorker helper function, which you‚Äôll use to decompose the broadcastNumbersToWorkers function in the next step. You should never busy wait; instead, investigate sigsuspend (by typing mansigsuspend) as a way of blocking indefinitely until at least one worker is known to be available.

‚óè Flesh out the implementation of broadcastNumbersToWorkers. I‚Äôm giving you a tiny hint here‚Äîthat broadcastNumbersToWorkers keeps on looping until either EOF is detected (or until the farm user messes up and deviated from the required input format). Investigate the SIGCONT signal as the means to restart another stopped process.

static void broadcastNumbersToWorkers() {

while (true) {

string line;

getline(cin, line);

if (cin.fail()) break;

size_t endpos;

/* long long num = */ stoll(line, &amp;endpos);

if (endpos != line.size()) break;

// you shouldn‚Äôt need all that many lines of additional code

}

}

‚óè Implement waitForAllWorkers, which does more or less what it says‚Äîit waits for all workers to self-halt and become available.

‚óè Last but not least, implement the closeAllWorkers routine to uninstall the SIGCHLD handler and restore the default (investigate the SIG_DFL constant), cajole all child processes to exit by sending them EOFs, and then wait for them to all actually exit.

Your implementation should be exception-safe, and nothing you write should orphan any memory. You should ssh into the rye machines (either sshrye01.stanford.edu or ssh rye02.stanford.edu to exercise your implementation over there to confirm the extra parallelization that comes with eight cores over just two).

Finally, my own solution has been compiled into an executable named farm_soln, and it‚Äôs sitting aside trace_soln in /usr/class/cs110/samples/assign3. That‚Äôs another sample executable for you to play with.
